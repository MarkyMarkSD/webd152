    <p>My favorite drink right now is mixed berry sparkling water. I don't have a specific brand I like, really I just like it as an alternative to water. I can sometimes struggle to get in the suggested 8 glasses of water a day, so mixing it up by adding in mixed berry sparkling water helps me achieve my goals.</p>
